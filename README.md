## Qilletni Frontend

This is the cross-platform frontend for [Qilletni](https://github.com/RubbaBoy/Qilletni). This is written in Dart/Flutter, managing state with [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc). As of now, authentication to the backend through Spotify credentials works on both mobile and desktop platforms.

This is currently in its _very_ early stages of development, in the near future screenshots will be posted to show progress.
